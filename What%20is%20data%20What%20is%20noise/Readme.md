# What is 'Data' what is 'Noise'

## Data

The actual unchanged, unfiltered, information we can acquire about the object with photographs. 
In order to get the best possible data you will often have to change lighting, use polarizers, or even wait for the sun to move. Keep your gear clean and in proper working condition.


## Noise

Everything that is not data is noise. Avoid the following at all cost.

### Shadows

The harder/darker the shadow on the object, the less actual information about the object is captured. Try to light the object as evenly and diffusely as possible. 
Avoid shadows at all cost.

An overcast sky is a decent lighting setup.

### Reflections

Reflections are technically noise and data. 
@beginners: start by treating reflections as noise. 

Reflections or glare hide actual information about the object. 
Avoid reflections at all cost.

Changing the angle towards the subject can help sometimes. Polarizers or better a cross polarization setup can help more often and to a higher degree.

### Moving objects
Everything that moves - weather the object itself or features in the background - introduce false information.
Avoid people moving in the background by picking the right day and time and moment of capture or simply tell your little sister to go bug mom.
Do not move the object if you have information in the background. A plain featureless background helps a lot.
### Camera defects
Self-explanatory.
