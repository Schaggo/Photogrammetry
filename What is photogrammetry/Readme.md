# What is Photogrammetry?

## The definition of

For now the definition of photogrammetry shall be: 

``Photogrammetry is a collection of contactless methods to measure objects based on photographic images.``

Some people argue photogrammetry is restricted to visible light photographs others argue that radar, laser, x-ray,  neutrino, and other imaging techniques should be included into the definition. This repo - at least for now - only concerns itself with photogrammetry from photographic images.


Important: 
Photogrammetry means measuring - not taking aesthetically pleasing images. The better your measurements the better the results.
