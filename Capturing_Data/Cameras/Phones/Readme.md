# Phones
Despite the many problems with phone cameras it is still possible to generate decent datasets and models with them. Still, here are the problems:

## Image processing
- Even with RAW apps it is often not possible to receive RAW unchanged data from the most phones.
    -> The hole pipeline from chip to file adds information to spit out pleasing images = Bad data.

## Sensors
- smaller form factor = smaller pixel size = less light

## Optics
- The optical media are often of bad quality
- Fixed aperture
    -> the small form factor and bad glassware necessitate a large iris = small depth of field

If you want to invest money in photogrammetry gear it is recommended to rather get a used system camera than to buy any phone.
