# Other cameras
## Phones
Use the one you have. Pay for a RAW camera app. If you want to invest money, buy a camera. See [phones](https://github.com/Schaggo/Photogrammetry/tree/main/Capturing_Data/Cameras/Phones)

## Action cams
No personal experience, but I've seen great models done with some of them

## Raspberry
You can build a decent camera system with a Raspberry Pi zero and the HQ cam (avoid the 6mm lens)
Recommended for home made rigs. See the PiScan project [link](https://www.pi3dscan.com/), [link](https://www.instructables.com/Multiple-Raspberry-PI-3D-Scanner/)

- programming skills required
- 3D printer necessary 
- basic knowledge on electrical systems and signal transport
- decent sensors
- one decent lens (16mm is ok)


## ESP
I experimented quite a bit with various sensors on the ESP32 AI-Thinker. In the end the sensors and optical properties render systems made with it rather a gimmick than a useful tool.
- low speed
- low memory
- no RAW
- bad sensors
- bad lenses

## OrangePi 
Bad driver support. Untested
