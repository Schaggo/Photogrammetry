# Buying guide
## DSLR and mirrorless cams
### Main features to look for
- 20 MP or greater chip resolution
- pixel size (the larger the better)
- crop factor (full frame, APS-C, MFT, fractions)
- known brand (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, Leica, Hasselblad,...)
- availability of lenses / lens mount (first and third party/ quality/ prices)
- low light behavior (until which ISO does the sensor produce low noise images) 
- frame count (if you buy a used camera check how many images have been taken / mirror assemblies and sensors degrade over time)


### Secondary features for higher tier cam systems 
- sensor size (full frame, mid format)
- writing speed (how fast the cam can save an image)
- flash system (synch speed, wired/wireless)
- external file transport (USB, Ethernet, Wifi)
