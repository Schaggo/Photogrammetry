# Metrics / Terminology

## Photography
@beginners: All of this is important stuff - learn it. 

ISO: The sensitivity of the sensor. The higher the ISO the more sensitive. The more sensitive the more noise.
[ISO:](https://www.slrlounge.com/glossary/iso-definition-photography/) 

Shutter speed: 
The duration during which the sensor is exposed to light. The longer the shutter is "open" the more light is captured by the sensor. 

Aperture/F.No: 
The camera system's iris size in comparison to the the size of the first optical element. The larger the F.No - the smaller the iris size. The larger the F.No the larger or deeper is the depth of field. The larger the F.No the less light will be captured by the sensor (darker image)

Focal Length:
Describes how strongly an optical system converges (or diverges) light. 
For practical purposes: The longer the focal length, the closer the object appears on the sensor / the longer the focal length the narrower is the field of view.

Depth of field: 
DoF describes the distance between the nearest and farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus.
"Acceptably" is important. The sensor size does not influence the DoP. 

Aberration: 
Aberration describes a collection of optical defects caused by the lens, it's elements, and also settings.
It is important to note that almost all lenses (I know of none that doesn't) introduce aberration at high F-Numbers. DXO mark features measurements for a lot of lenses.

Resolution in Megapixel: 
The MP count of a sensor describes the total number of pixels of the sensor.
Be aware: cheap cameras fake their numbers.  

Factual resolution: 
Having a high MP sensor does not directly translate to factual resolution. 
The factual resolution describes the actual detail a sensor-lens combination can resolve.
A common method for measuring the factual resolution is to capture USAF-targets and note the smallest line pair/triplet the image can resolve. 
A bad example would be 100MP phone cameras. High MP, low factual resolution. 

## Photogrammetry

Ground sampling distance (GSD) in Pixels per Millimeter:
PpM describes the resolution at which an object is captured and can theoretically be reconstructed. The higher the PpM the more detail can be calculated. If you decrease the distance at which you take images of the object, the higher the PpM in relation to the factual resolution of the camera.

To calculate GSD: 

GSD = (DISTANCE x SENSORwidth) / (IMAGEwidth x FOCALLENGTH)
